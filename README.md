### REVIEWER APP

## Description

This is a CLI application for students and teachers to give reviews. 

We have three models: `Student`, `Teacher`, and `Review`.

- A `Student` has many `Review`s. A `Teacher` has many `Review`s. A `Review` belongs to a `Student` and a `Teacher`.

- `Student` - `Teacher` is a many to many relationship.

- Both `Student`s and `Teacher`s alike have the opportunity to leave a review about programs that they are in or teach. 

- `Student`s can see, edit, delete their own `Review`s.
- `Teacher`s can see all `Review`s, filter them by 'program' or see, edit, and delete their own `Review`s.

- In the `Review` class:
 - you can pull and see the reviews that were made with date/time upon when the review was made.

To create the review.db file and navigate the SQLite tables in your code editor, enter:
